						Homicide is the direct or indirect killing of another person.  The severity of how punishment is dispensed in homicide cases depends heavily upon the circumstances at the time the crime occurred.

Justifiable Homicide — a suspect was killed by a victim acting in self-defense.  The Philadelphia Police Department will often record these incidents and they appear as "Homicide - Justified" in crime reports.

1st Degree — a homicide where the killing of another was intentional.  It is intentional if the killing is by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing.

2nd Degree — when the defendant was a principal or an accomplice during the commission of another felony at the time of the murder.  For instance, if someone plans to rob a store, if during the course of that robbery a homicide occurred then it is murder in the second degree.

3rd Degree — any other homicides which weren't intentional or planned or occurred during the course of a felony.  For instance, if someone shoots another without having planned to commit the shooting and was not committing another felony at the time.

Voluntary Manslaughter — Voluntary manslaughter is defined as an intentional or knowing killing of an individual without lawful justification, if at the time of the killing the defendant is acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation by the individual killed or another whom the actor tries to kill but negligently or accidently causes the death of the individual killed.  Voluntary manslaughter is a felony of the first degree, punishable by ten to twenty years in prison.  If someone shoots another because the person so enraged the shooter by his actions, and kills him, it is voluntary manslaughter.

Involuntary Manslaughter — Involuntary manslaughter is defined as when a person, as the result of doing of an unlawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, or the doing of a lawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, causes the death of another.  If a motorist is driving recklessly and dangerously at high speed resulting in a crash that kills another person, it is involuntary manslaughter.

						Robbery has been committed if during the commission of a theft, the defendant injures someone, threatens them with injury, commits any first or second degree felony, uses force (no matter how slight), or takes money from a financial institution by making a demand upon an employee of the institution.

A "home invasion" where a defendant enters an occupied home or business demanding cash or goods is also classified as a robbery.

Assault is any infliction of bodily harm or intention to inflict bodily harm on another.  Pennsylvania defines two types: aggravated assault and simple assault.  Most shooting incidents in Philadelphia which do not immediately result in homicide are classified as Aggravated Assault.

Simple assault is typical when action is taken recklessly or carelessly or no serious bodily injuries were caused.  The punishment is a second-degree misdeameanor.

Aggravated assault is a felony and includes attacks causing (or intending to cause) serious bodily injury.  Assaults on police officers are also treated as aggravated assault.  The punishment is a felony and can be up to the first degree and carry a punishment up to 20 years in prison.

						The taking or withholding of another person's property by deception.  This category does not include thefts of motor vehicles or items stolen from inside motor vehicles.

Theft is the most commonly-reported crime in Philadelphia.  Punishment for theft depends on the value of the object that was stolen and what type of object.

Pennsylvania Law distinguishes between two types of property:
						
Movable Property — Any object that is not real estate or an intangible object such as securities.

Immovable Property — Real estate, securities and other intangible objects of value.

The Philadelphia Police classify auto-related thefts such as stolen vehicles (VT) "stolen motor vehicle" and stealing items inside of vehicles (TA) "theft from auto".  Further, the police separately report the recovery of a stolen auto as a crime report to designate where criminals leave behind vehicles that they steal.  These reports are classified as (RV) for "recovered vehicle".

Rape is a crime where a suspect forcibly or under threat of force engages in sexual intercourse with another person.  Rape can also occur if the defendant has substantially impaired the victim's ability to control his/her conduct by intoxicating the victim without his/her knowledge or if the victim has a mental disability.

Rape is considered a first degree felony in Pennsylvania and can carry a sentence up to twenty years in prison.  In addition to this term, if the defendant used any type of intoxicating drug in the commission of this offense, the sentence may be extended for an additional ten years.

This is an auto-related crime which is tracked separately from other types of theft.

Motor vehicle theft is the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle from the possession of its owner.  It is treated as a theft of more than $2,000 under Pennsylvania statute.  This crime category is often confused with "theft from vehicle" which is a theft of an object inside a motor vehicle.  Those thefts are coded "TV" for "theft from vehicle".

If the stolen vehicle is recovered, a separate crime incident report will be filed by police at the location where the vehicle was recovered.  That is reported as (RV) "Motor Vehicle Recovery".  This allows police to monitor where stolen vehicles are winding up when they are found.					</Label>

Pennsylvania's DUI statute makes it illegal for an individual to drive, operate, or be in actual physical control of motor vehicle under any of the following circumstances:

● Imbibing a sufficient amount of alcohol such that they are incapable of safe driving
● When there is any amount of an un-precribed controlled substance (including all illegal drugs) in their blood
● When, due to the influence of any drug or combination of drugs (including prescription medications) the individual is incapable of safe driving.

A suspect does not have to actually be driving the vehicle in order to be charged with DUI.  Because Pennsylvania specifies that anyone who is drunk or on drugs and in a position where they could have driven the car, they are in "actual physical control" of that vehicle, therefore DUI applies.

Arrest and charge reports of DUI offenders will reflect if the defendant is a Tier I, II, or III offender.  Drivers with charges of "1st Off" are low-level consumers of alcohol, as those under the influence of narcotics are typically charged as Tier III offenders or will be given a narcotics charge if narcotics were recovered on their person or in the vehicle.</Label>
